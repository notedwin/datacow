Data Cow is a collection of small tools used to move data around. It is composed of a bunch of python scripts currently.

All scripts are designed to be run from the command line with a .env file in the same directory.

Current work is on unifying scripts into a standalone executable that runs pipelines on a scheduled basis.

Work is done to improve grafana dashboard:
